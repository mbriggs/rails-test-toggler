Rails Test Toggler
==================

I use rinari, but found the rinari-find-test function to be not terribly reliable, and didn't like how there was no generic way to flip back. This is a very simple plugin that does that. It is also my first bit of elisp, so any comments or improvements would be welcomed :)
